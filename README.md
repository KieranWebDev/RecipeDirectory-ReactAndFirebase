## Project Details

- A recipe create site that I created following a [Net Ninja course]("https://www.udemy.com/course/build-web-apps-with-react-firebase/").  The front end was build with React and React Router, while initially Json Server was used to replicate a back-end which was later swapped out with Firebase. 

## What I learned and the challenges faced 

- Coding along with this project offered a great opportunity to familiarise myself with some new concepts such as useContext and UseReducer whilst also getting some reps in with more familiar concepts such as useState and UseEffect as well as React Router. 

- This project uses a custom UseFetch Hook which was later refactored to also handle Post requests. I can see how convenient and reuseable custom hooks can be i.e. solve the problem once and then reuse the component. Although the custom hook was no longer used once the project backend was switched to Firebase, I left it in the codebase as a learning point and as I will probably be able to reuse it in later projects.

-This was my first experience with using a back-end as a Service provider like Firebase and I found it a relatively stress-free experience. I was surprised at how easy and seamless it was to create tables. Although the syntax used to fetch data from Firebase differs from that used with what I’m familiar with thus far, it seems to follow a similar logic, and thus I didn't feel like I had to learn a completely new concept. Although I’m just dipping my toes into it at the moment, I look forward to learning more. 

- More practice with creating forms although I have since used form libraries such as React Form Hook and find them much easier to use than conventional React forms.

- Lost of practice and reps using map to iterate through data,  which is always good. 

- Gained more confidence with using React Router.

- I was able to get some practice with using the UseContext and UseReducer Hooks for the color theme selectors. Although a simple example, it helped me to gained a deeper understanding of how these hooks work and I look forward to learning more.
